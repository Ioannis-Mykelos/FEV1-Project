# FEV1-Project
Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1), measures the volume that a person can exhale in the first second of a  forceful expiration after a full inspiration. This measure will be used as an indicator of lung function.
In this project we use the data set of young people ages 3 to 19 years old and measure their lung capacity regarding smokers and non smokers.
We also check the correlation between lung capacity and age and create heat maps about this correlation.
Finally we create two histograms over the young people for smokers and non smokers.
